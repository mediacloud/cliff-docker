CLIFF Docker
============

The official Docker image for the [CLIFF-CLAVIN](http://cliff.mediameter.org/) geolocation software.

**Note: CLAVIN, and by extension CLIFF, is very memory hungry due to the geonames index. To properly
run, a minimum of 4GB of RAM is necessary. Any less and you'll experience errors.**

Building the Image
------------------

Build using

```
docker build -t cliff:2.6.1 .
```

Running the Image
-----------------

It is setup to use the default port of `8080`. Run using

```
docker run -p "8080:8080" -d cliff:2.6.1
```

You can test it at a URL like:

```
http://localhost:8080/cliff-2.6.1/parse/text?q=This%20is%20some%20text%20about%20New%20York%20City,%20and%20maybe%20about%20Accra%20as%20well,%20and%20maybe%20Boston%20as%20well.
```
